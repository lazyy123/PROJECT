                  <p>
                    Terracotta figurines are a mode of artistic and religious expression frequently found in ancient 
                    Greece. These figurines abound and provide an invaluable testimony to the everyday life and religion 
                    of the ancient Greeks. The so-called Tanagra figurines, in fact made elsewhere as well, are one of
                     the most important types.Modelling is the most common and simplest technique. It is also used for 
                     the realization of bronzes: the prototypes are made out of raw clay. The small sizes are directly 
                     worked with the hand. For the larger models, the coroplath (or κοροπλάθος koropláthos, manufacturer 
                     of figurines) presses the clay pellets or wads against a wooden restraint.The mold is obtained by 
                     application of a bed of clay or plaster on the prototype. Simple molds, used by the Greeks of the 
                     continent until the 4th century BC, are simply dried.

                    The flask is formed as a cockle shell; its small shape is ample enough to contain an amount of oil, 
                    and probably a perfumed oil, that was used by the Greeks, both men and women, in cosmetic and 
                    hygienic purposes. Athletes would apply oil to skin of their naked bodies to protect it from the 
                    sun, as well as the wrestlers would do it in addition to make wrestling even a more difficult task
                     as it is not easy to catch the body with the oiled and slippery skin.The piece belongs to the group
                      of plastic vases, mold-made and painted vessels that were mass produced from the end of the 7th 
                      century B.C. in a wide variety of shapes. They can represent a human figure or a head, animal, 
                      plant or object; they are all topped by a small-vase neck with a disk mouth.

                    The pottery of ancient Greece from c. 1000 to c. 400 BCE provides not only some of the most distinctive vase
                     shapes from antiquity but also some of the oldest and most diverse representations of the cultural beliefs 
                     and practices of the ancient Greeks. Further, pottery, with its durability (even when broken) and lack of 
                     appeal to treasure hunters, is one of the great archaeological survivors and is, therefore, an important 
                     tool for archaeologists and historians in determining the chronology of ancient Greece. Greek pottery was 
                     invariably made on the potter’s wheel and usually made in separate horizontal sections: the foot, the lower 
                     and upper body, the neck, and finally the handles, if necessary.These sections were then joined together with
                      a clay ‘slip’ after drying and it is possible in many cases to see the prints of the potter impressed on the 
                      inside of the vessel.  </p>

                    The sculpture of ancient Greece from 800 to 300 BCE took early inspiration from Egyptian and Near 
                    Eastern monumental art, and over centuries evolved into a uniquely Greek vision of the art form. Greek 
                    artists would reach a peak of artistic excellence which captured the human form in a way never before 
                    seen and which was much copied. Greek sculptors were particularly concerned with proportion, poise, 
                    and the idealised perfection of the human body, and their figures in stone and bronze have become 
                    some of the most recognisable pieces of art ever produced by any civilization.The oldest Greek stone
                     sculptures (of limestone) date from the mid-7th century BCE and were found at Thera. In this period, 
                     bronze free-standing figures with their own base became more common, and more ambitious subjects were attempted
                      such as warriors, charioteers, and musicians.

                  <p>
                    There are no surviving masks that were actually worn from Ancient Greek Theater. This is due in part 
                    to the fact that they were made from perishable material such as “stiffened linen or wood” (MAE). 
                    We do have some remaining terracotta examples, which were not worn, but would have been dedicated 
                    to temples. Some of the earliest known images of Gorgons in fact come from terracotta masks from 
                    the 7th century from a shrine of Artemis (Napier 1986). These terracotta examples were votive 
                    substitutes for the real things (Mack 1994). As for their form, “masks covered more than just 
                    the face, being put on over the head like a helmet” (Mack 1994). In fact, in both “The Iliad” 
                    and Sophocles’ “Ajax” the helmet acts as a terrifying mask that scares both Hector’s and Ajax’s 
                    sons respectively. This form of mask was probably not terribly comfortable. It covered the face, 
                    slightly restricting breathing and most likely was a little weighty. It had to be placed carefully 
                    so as to allow eyesight for the actor and the actor has to be constantly aware of keeping the mask 
                    in check. In one of the Interviews, I discussed this placement with an actor.
